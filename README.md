# TennsiDoublesPlanner
This repository contains solutions for the following problem: we have 5 friends who want to play tennis (doubles), and they want to schedule matches with constraints listed below:
- total number of matches must equal 5
- every player must participate in exactly 4 matches
- every player must rest in 1 match
- teams cannot repeat between matches (e.g. player1 and player2 can team up only in 1 match)

Available solutions:
- Markov chain (best)
- Q-learning
